# HueJS: a Vue-based client for Philips Hue

HueJS is a simple web client for Philips Hue systems built with Vue. It connects directly to the Hue hub (so you need to be in the same network).

## Installation

Simply clone this repository and point your browser to index.html. Insert the IP address of your local Hue hub (can be found in the Hue configuration app). Hit the 'link button' on the hub and click 'register'. HueVue obtains a user token from the Hub and stores it in the browser's local storage, so registration needs to be done only once.
